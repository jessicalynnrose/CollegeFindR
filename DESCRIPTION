Description: Narrowing down what colleges a student should apply to can be a daunting task with thousands of
universities to choose from. My package, CollegeFindR, uses the largest publically available dataset from the department of 
education to present students with a list of schools meeting specific criteria they input. With each questions answered by the student, 
the original list of over 6000 colleges can be narrowed down to a smaller, personalized grouping of schools and their corresponding
websites to learn more information.
